# cadence_inverter
A CMOS inverter design in Cadence Virtuoso using the GPDK 180nm technology process. This repository includes the schematic design, layout, DC and transient simulation results, and AV extraction. The design is absolutely following all rules, hence DRC and LVS are running without errors.
